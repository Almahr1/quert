# Go Web Crawler Engineering Document for LLM Training Data Collection

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive engineering document provides detailed technical guidance for building a production-grade web crawler in Go designed to collect high-quality text data for language model training. The crawler architecture emphasizes **single-machine scalability** through sophisticated goroutine management, **ethical crawling practices** with robots.txt compliance, and **high-quality content extraction** optimized for LLM training pipelines.

**Key design principles** include channel-based coordination for scalability, worker pool patterns for resource management, comprehensive text cleaning and deduplication, and robust operational monitoring. The system is designed to crawl millions of pages while maintaining politeness standards and producing clean, deduplicated text data suitable for language model training.

**Expected performance targets**: 10,000-50,000 pages per hour on a single 4-8 core machine, with memory usage under 4GB and minimal impact on target websites through adaptive rate limiting and respect for server resources.

## System Architecture Overview

### High-Level Architecture

The crawler follows a **producer-consumer pattern** with three main components working in concert:

**URL Management System**: Manages URL discovery, normalization, deduplication, and prioritization through a sophisticated dual-queue frontier architecture that separates priority management from politeness enforcement.

**Crawling Engine**: Executes concurrent HTTP requests using Go's goroutine-based worker pools, with adaptive rate limiting, circuit breakers, and comprehensive error handling to ensure reliable data collection at scale.

**Content Processing Pipeline**: Extracts and cleans text content specifically for LLM training, implementing multiple stages of quality assessment, deduplication, and format optimization for downstream model training workflows.

### Core Design Patterns

**Channel-Based Coordination**: The system uses Go channels as the primary coordination mechanism, eliminating shared memory and race conditions while providing natural backpressure handling and graceful shutdown capabilities.

**Worker Pool Architecture**: Fixed-size goroutine pools prevent resource exhaustion while maximizing concurrency, with dynamic scaling based on system performance and server response characteristics.

**Circuit Breaker Protection**: Per-host circuit breakers prevent cascading failures and respect server capacity limits, automatically backing off from problematic hosts while maintaining overall crawling throughput.

## Detailed Component Design

### URL Frontier and Queue Management

The URL frontier implements a **dual-queue architecture** optimized for both priority and politeness:

**Front Queues (Priority Management)**:
- Multiple FIFO queues organized by priority levels (1 to F, where F typically equals 10-20)
- URLs assigned priority based on: change frequency, PageRank metrics, content type classification, and domain authority
- Biased queue selection ensures higher-priority content gets crawled first while maintaining diversity

**Back Queues (Politeness Enforcement)**:
- One queue per host domain to ensure politeness constraints
- Heap-based scheduling tracks earliest allowable contact time per host
- Three-to-one rule: maintain approximately 3x more back queues than worker threads
- Persistent checkpointing enables graceful restart and state recovery

**URL Normalization Pipeline**:
```
Raw URL → Case normalization → Percent-encoding cleanup → 
Path normalization → Query parameter sorting → Fragment removal → 
Canonical URL
```

**Deduplication Strategy**:
- **Level 1**: Bloom filter for exact URL matching (10 bits per URL, 0.1% false positive rate)
- **Level 2**: Content fingerprinting using SHA-256 for exact duplicate detection
- **Level 3**: Simhash-based similarity detection for near-duplicate identification
- **Level 4**: Semantic deduplication using content embeddings for paraphrased content

### Concurrent Crawling Engine

**Worker Pool Implementation**:
- Fixed pool of 2-4x CPU cores goroutines for I/O-bound web crawling
- Buffered job channels with capacity of 2x pool size to prevent blocking
- Context-based cancellation for graceful shutdown and request timeouts
- HTTP client pool with connection reuse and keep-alive optimization

**Rate Limiting and Politeness**:
- Token bucket algorithm using `golang.org/x/time/rate` for precise rate control
- Adaptive rate adjustment based on server response times and error rates
- Robots.txt parsing with 24-hour caching and proper fallback handling
- Exponential backoff for failed requests with jitter to prevent thundering herd

**Error Handling Framework**:
- Transient errors (timeouts, 503, 429): Exponential backoff retry with circuit breaker
- Permanent errors (404, 401): Immediate failure with dead letter queue storage
- Circuit breaker states: Closed (normal) → Open (failing fast) → Half-Open (testing recovery)
- Comprehensive error classification and metrics collection for operational insights

### Content Extraction and Processing

**Text Extraction Pipeline**:
- **trafilatura** for main content extraction with boilerplate removal
- **main_content_extractor** for LLM-optimized content processing
- Multi-level fallback: trafilatura → goquery → basic HTML stripping
- Content validation using length metrics, coherence scoring, and language detection

**Text Cleaning and Normalization**:
- Unicode normalization and encoding error correction
- HTML tag and CSS/JavaScript code removal
- Whitespace normalization and structure preservation
- Language-specific processing with **fasttext** language detection
- Toxic content filtering and PII detection/redaction

**Quality Assessment Framework**:
- **Perplexity-based filtering**: Language model scoring for text naturalness
- **Content type classification**: Different quality metrics for news, documentation, forums
- **LLM-as-a-judge evaluation**: Multi-dimensional quality scoring (coherence, information value, factuality)
- **Statistical metrics**: Entropy measures, BLEU/ROUGE scores against reference text

**Data Segmentation for LLM Training**:
- **Semantic chunking** with embedding-based boundary detection
- **Recursive character splitting** with hierarchical separators
- **Overlap preservation** for maintaining context across chunk boundaries
- **Document structure awareness** respecting headers, paragraphs, and logical divisions

### Storage and Data Management

**Data Serialization Strategy**:
- **Pre-training data**: Parquet format for columnar efficiency and metadata preservation
- **Fine-tuning data**: JSONL format for structured instruction-response pairs
- **Quality metadata**: Separate tracking of source URLs, extraction quality scores, and processing timestamps
- **Compression optimization**: LZ4 or Snappy for fast compression with reasonable ratios

**Batch Processing Architecture**:
- Write-behind caching with configurable batch sizes (typically 100-1000 records)
- Async storage operations to decouple crawling from I/O
- Connection pooling for database operations with proper timeout handling
- Distributed storage options using cloud-native solutions for scale-out scenarios

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management Optimization

**Garbage Collection Tuning**: Adjust `GOGC` environment variable to balance memory usage and GC overhead. For memory-intensive crawling, values between 50-200% provide optimal performance trade-offs.

**Object Pool Utilization**: Implement `sync.Pool` for frequently allocated objects like HTTP response buffers, HTML parsing structures, and URL processing temporaries to reduce allocation pressure.

**Connection Pool Configuration**: Optimize HTTP transport settings for concurrent connection limits, idle timeouts, and keep-alive behavior to maximize connection reuse efficiency.

### Concurrency Optimization

**Worker Pool Sizing**: Start with 2-4x CPU cores for I/O-bound crawling workloads, then tune based on monitoring data from CPU utilization, response times, and queue depths.

**Channel Buffer Management**: Use buffered channels with capacity equal to 2x worker pool size to prevent blocking while maintaining bounded memory usage.

**Context Propagation**: Implement proper context cancellation throughout the request pipeline to enable graceful shutdown and prevent goroutine leaks.

### Network and I/O Performance

**HTTP/2 Optimization**: Enable HTTP/2 for compatible servers to reduce connection overhead and improve request multiplexing efficiency.

**Request Compression**: Accept gzip/deflate encoding to reduce network transfer times, particularly important for text-heavy content extraction.

**DNS Optimization**: Implement DNS caching and configure appropriate timeouts to prevent DNS resolution from becoming a bottleneck.

**Bandwidth Management**: Implement global and per-host bandwidth limiting to prevent network saturation and maintain system stability.
